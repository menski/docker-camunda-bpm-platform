# Camunda BPM Platform Docker Images

This Camunda BPM community project provides docker images of the latest Camunda
BPM platform releases. The images can be used to demonstrate and test the
Camunda BPM platform or can be extended with own process applications. It is
planned to provide images on the official docker registry for every upcoming
release, which includes alpha releases.
